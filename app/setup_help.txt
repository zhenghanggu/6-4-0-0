Hello team! Here are the steps to get started!

First, we are using a virtual enviornment for this project, and using python 2.7. To load the virtual enviornment, in terminal go to the Team049 folder and do the following:
	
	source env/bin/activate

You should see (env) prefixing the current path in terminal.

Now to run the app, cd to the ERMS_app folder and type:
	
	python run.py

You should see a message saying the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

To view it in action, load up a web browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

You should see the login page. I have added the first user as per the report. You can test it to make sure its validating from the database:

	username: username1
	password: pass1

Try using an incorrect password to see what happens in that case!

And that's it! Remember, when you make changes, you'll need to restart the server to see them.
